S 2.1
Russia's school starting age is like that of major Chinese cities, whereas France mandates a strict age of six. Unlike China's fully free universities, Russia and France both charge tuition, although at low rates. Compulsory education lasts until age fifteen in Russia, which is a year less than in France. However, Russia's higher education enrollment rate far exceeds China's 7.5 percent. Finally, Russia's divided secondary structure is similar to the two-stage system in France.

V 2.2
1.I hated maths at school. I didn’t do any of the homework, never payed attention to the
teacher and skipped classes whenever I could. Of course, the first time round I studied for my exams and had to pass them the following year. The second time round I passed, which I
was really pleased about. It really boosted my confidence and I decided to apply to one of
the best universities. To my amazement, I got in and I’m here now – studying maths!

2 Mike is very bright. He always studied very well when he was at school. I’m sure he’ll get
a good degree, even though he doesn’t ____ very hard. Of course, he hardly ever revised
lectures or _____ the things we’ve done. I sometimes resent the fact he’s so clever!
